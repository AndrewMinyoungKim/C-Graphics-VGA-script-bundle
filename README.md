# C-Graphics-VGA-script-bundle
Scripts that utilize the FPGA board to demonstrate the visual capabilities of the VGA monitor
The first script consists of a horizontal line that will move up and down the screen on the VGA display
The second script consists of 8 randomly placed blocks (same # of vertices as octogon) on the VGA display, connected together by lines,
and they will all have random colours. These squares will be moving in random directions bouncing off the walls
